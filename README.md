# guess-game
This is a simple game created with python.

## Description
* Here we have provided a default list with three indices.
* Two of the indices are empty and one is occupied by 'O'.
* A function in this program shuffles the list.
* After shuffling the index of 'O' will be changed.
* The current index position of 'O' wont be revealed.
* The user now has to guess the index of '0'.
* Please note that in this game, while guessing the position of 'O',
  the user should input the position of 'O' from values [1,2,3].
* Here value 1 represents index position 0.
* value 2 represents index position 1.
* value 3 represents index position 2.
* A total of three chances are given.
* After the third chance, 'out of chance' will be print on screen.
* However the user can stop the game even before the third trial itself.
